If there are alot of LEDs you might want to add and external power source rather than using the 5v from the Arduino see 2nd image

Connect one leg of each button to a digital pin on the Arduino Uno (e.g. pin 4 for the white button, and pin 5 for the red button).
Connect the other leg of each button to ground.
Add a pull-up resistor to each button by connecting a resistor (e.g. 10kÎ©) between the same digital pin and the 5V pin on the Arduino Uno.
